# Surfs Up
# Reason behind project
## A motivated investor is interested in building an Ice Cream and Surf shop on the beautiful island of Oahu, Hawaii. However, the investor wants to know some weather conditions before comitting to their venture. We used SQLAlchemy to query and SQLite as our Database.
